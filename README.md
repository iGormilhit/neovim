# My `neovim` setup

Having used `neovim` for a few month, with symlinks for the configuration and the plugins, I want to start a new setup.

Firstly, I don't use any more `pathogen` for the management of plugins, but `vim-plug` instead.

For `vim-livedown`, the `npm` `livedown` package needs to be installed globally:

`npm install -g livedown`
